Final project for 67442 Mobile App Development:

Using all our accumulated knowledge in iOS app development, we built a mobile app that allows users to find and use recipes in an intuitive and user-friendly environment. Instead of hovering over their phones constantly, users are able to interact with the recipes indirectly: simple and concise navigation allows users to minimize physical interaction with recipes and text-to-speech allows users to be away from their phones while listening to the instructions. The app was developed using Swift and Xcode over the course of a 5 week period.
